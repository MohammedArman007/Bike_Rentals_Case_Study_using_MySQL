CASE STUDY 1

Emily is preparing a sales report. She needs to know the total revenue 
from rentals by month, the total by year, and the all-time across all the 
years. 
Display the total revenue from rentals for each month, the total for each 
year, and the total across all the years. Do not take memberships into 
account. There should be 3 columns: 
year , 
month , and 
revenue .
Sort the results chronologically. Display the year total after all the month 
totals for the corresponding year. Show the all-time total as the last row.


CASE STUDY 2

Next, Emily would like data about memberships purchased in 2023, with 
subtotals and grand totals for all the different combinations of membership 
types and months.
Display the total revenue from memberships purchased in 2023 for each 
combination of month and membership type. Generate subtotals and 
grand totals for all possible combinations.  There should be 3 columns: 
membership_type_name , 
month , and 
total_revenue .
Sort the results by membership type name alphabetically and then 
chronologically by month.
